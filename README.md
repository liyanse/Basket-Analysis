The Apriori algorithm is an algorithm for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning over transactional databases. It is designed to operate on databases containing transactions, where each transaction is a set of items. The Apriori algorithm is used to identify the association rules between items in the transactions, where the association measure used is the support.

The Apriori algorithm works by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by the Apriori algorithm are used to generate association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in fields such as market basket analysis.

The Apriori algorithm has two key components: the candidate generation function and the support counting function. The candidate generation function generates a list of all possible item sets (also known as candidates) that could be frequent based on the frequent itemsets found in the previous iteration. The support counting function then counts the number of occurrences of each candidate item set in the database and retains only those candidates that meet the minimum support threshold. This process is repeated iteratively until no more frequent item sets can be found.
